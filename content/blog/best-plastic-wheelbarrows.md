Ah, the humble and trusty wheelbarrow. A great tool to rely on for gardening. It can carry:

Supplies
Tools
Compost
Debris
To and from your garden with ease. It is a must-have for gardens.

The thing about the modest wheelbarrow is that it has been around for centuries. The ancient Europeans and Chinese were using them!

Naturally, there are many types for you to choose from. This includes plastic wheelbarrows. With so many options, which one should you choose?

This guide will give you a quick overview of how to find the best plastic wheelbarrow for your needs.

1. LOAD CAPACITY AND SPACE
This should be the first thing you consider when buying a wheelbarrow.

If you’re planning on larger jobs, you’ll have a difficult time with a shallow bucket capacity.

Likewise, if you’re only doing smaller gardening projects, it may not be worth your while to buy a heavy-duty wheelbarrow.

Heavy-duty wagons will come with large tires and thicker construction so they can handle the larger loads.

This can make a big difference in price.

Really think about what types of projects you’re looking to tackle.

2. TIRES
Tires are an important element for your wagon. After all, it’s what allows it to travel!

On a plastic wheelbarrow, you’ll typically find plastic wheels. They might have treads or they might not.

Whether or not plastic tires are what you need will depend on your garden. If you’re going to move your wheelbarrow across grass carrying a small load, these simple tires should be fine.

If you’re going to be moving your wheelbarrow over uneven terrain such as rocks with a heavy load, you’re going to need larger, rubber tires.

These tires will have reinforced rubber and will be filled with air. This design will allow the tires to move over uneven, rough terrain much easier due to the shock absorption they’ll provide.

3. YOUR CAPABILITIES
The capacity, space, and tires mean nothing if you’re not able to move your wheelbarrow!

Compost, debris, supplies, and tools can all add up. Keep this in mind.

Your project and how you plan on executing your project will need to determine which type of wheelbarrow you will be able to use.

If it’s a large project, you may be tempted to buy a larger wagon but hold off if it’ll cause you more stress than you need.

This is especially important if you have mobility issues. You will be lifting items higher than the actual cart itself to load them in. And some carts are meant for pushing while others are for pulling.

Before buying, consider mobile capabilities. Only get what works for you and your project. Bigger is not always better.

THE PLASTIC WHEELBARROW AND YOU
A plastic wheelbarrow is a real wonder. They’re easier to use, move, and store. They’re a great asset to any gardening project.

In this article we will look at baby name ideas from around the world.  Starting off with names inspired from Greek Mythology and then working into some of the more unusual baby names compare to more popular ones in America and the world and those inspired by Authors.

## Baby Girl Names Based on Greek Mythology:

The Ancient Greek Goddesses Provide Many Unique Names

Tales of Greek gods and goddesses dates back to 2200 B.C. The women who called ancient Greece home were strong and powerful, making their names perfect choices for unique names for newborn girls.

## Aphrodite

Parents searching for a name that automatically conjures up images of love and beauty should look no further than the goddess Aphrodite. The goddess of love, beauty and fertility was also known as a quick-tempered, mercurial young woman.

Homer writes that Aphrodite was the daughter of Zeus and Dione. In his tale of the Trojan War, he spins a story of Zeus admonishing his daughter, telling her to leave matters of war to her brother Ares. Zeus tells Aphrodite that she should instead focus on marriage and matters of the heart. Her Roman equivalent is Venus.

## Artemis

For a name that captures a sporty feel, Artemis is a good choice. Artemis could be considered the original tomboy. She was depicted as the virgin (young) goddess of the hunt. Artemis is often depicted together with her twin brother Apollo. She assisted women with childbirth, but was also quick to kill with an arrow from her quiver constantly strapped to her back. Her Roman equivalent is Diana.

## Athena

The patron goddess of Athens, Athena was primarily the goddess of arts and crafts, but also of war. Athena is also considered the goddess of wisdom because of her birth myth. When her father Zeus was married to Metis, a woman renowned for her wisdom, she became pregnant. Zeus was warned that if Metis gave birth to a son, he would overthrow him, just as Zeus had overthrown his own father.

To prevent this, Zeus swallowed Metis. He was soon overcome with a splitting headache. To relieve his pain, he asked the craftsman god Hephaestus to hit Zeus’ forehead with an ax. Athena jumped out of Zeus’ head in full armour. Her Roman equivalent is Minerva.

## Demeter

For a name that embodies nature and the outdoors, Demeter should come to mind. The goddess of agriculture, Demeter was Zeus’ sister and Persephone’s mother. Homer wrote that Demeter was heartbroken when her daughter was taken to the underground world to be Hades’ queen. She wandered the earth in search of her daughter. During this time, crops withered and died, bringing on perpetual winter.

Eventually, Hades was persuaded to allow Persephone to spend half the year with him underground, and the other half above with Demeter, dividing the year into the barren season, and the fertile half. When depicted in art, Demeter is often shown carrying a sheaf of grain to represent her connection with agriculture and nature. Her Roman equivalent is Ceres.

## Persephone

Persephone is often associated with innocence because of Homer’s tale in the Odyssey of Persephone’s abduction by Hades. Her myth was also used to explain the natural processes of the seasons, with spring and summer bringing about flowers and crops, and fall and summer punctuated by barren fields.

She is often depicted in art robed and carrying a sheaf of grain. She is often smiling demurely, representative of her eternal role as the innocent maiden. While she does not have an exact Roman equivalent, the Romans told her tale from the Greeks, sometimes changing her name to Proserpine.

Mums and dads spend much of the pregnancy searching for just the right name for their baby. Turning to ancient Greek for a name such as Aphrodite, Athena, Demeter, Athena, or Persephone, parents can choose a name that is time-honoured and steeped in myth, as well as meaning.


## Baby Boy Names That Begin With W: Unusual & Popular Male Name Choices

Looking for a baby boy name that begins with W? With help from the U.S. Social Security Baby Name Index, here are some popular, classic, and unusual choices.

William. William has always been an extremely popular name in the United States, as well as in Great Britain, Australia, and Canada. In America, it finally dropped out of the top 10 in the 1970s, but then it started climbing again and ranked at #10 in 2020. Why the enduring popularity of this name? Perhaps it has to do with nicknames, as William has versatility. For years, Billys and Bills abounded, and these days, parents are using the nickname Liam (the second part of William). William comes from an ancient Germanic name that means "determined protector."

Wyatt. Wyatt is both a Western sounding name and a last-name-turned-first-name, so it's not surprising that this name is becoming trendy, It ranked at #82 in 2020. Wyatt comes from an Old English name that means "war strength."

Wesley. Wesley cracked the top 100 during the 1980s, but fell to #190 in 2020. Wesley comes from an Old English name that means "Western meadow." For something a little different, try Weston.

Walter. Walter was big in the early twentieth century, when Walter Cronkite and Wally Cleaver were born. The name gradually become less common and has fallen out of favor. Parents in search of an old-fashioned name that hasn't become trendy yet might snatch up this classic. Walter comes from an ancient Germanic name that means "commander of the army."

Warren. Warren has always been Walter's less popular younger brother. The name was fairly popular during the 1920s, but isn't used much anymore. Unlike Walter, Warren doesn't have any built-in nicknames ("Warry" just doesn't sound all that upbeat). Warren comes from a Norman French name that means "stockyard."

Walker, Wilson, & Whittaker. If you like the last-name-turned-first-name craze but want a name that isn't overly popular, try out one of these. Walker is from an Old English name that means "clothes washer." Wilson, as you might guess, means "son of William." Whittaker is from an Old English name that means "wheat farm."
Wade & Wayne. These names have a lot to offer-- they're short, strong, a little bit Western, and not the least bit trendy. Wade is from an Old English name that means "able to go." Wayne is from an Old English name that means "wagon builder."

Waylon. Like country names? Here's a classic that isn't used much. Waylon comes from an Old English name that means "roadside land."

Winston. Thanks to Winston Churchill, this unusual name has a strong and historical appeal. Winston comes from an Old English name that means "joyful stone."

Woodrow & Woody. Sadly, the sexual connotations of "woody" might make this name fodder for playground bullies. These names come from an English expression that means "row of house by the woods."
Waldo, Wilmer, & Wilbur. Old-fashioned names are making a comeback, but don't expect to see these clunkers anytime soon.

## Baby Boy Names That Begin With M: Popular and Unusual Male Name Choices

If you're looking for a baby boy name that starts with the letter M, you'll find lots of choices. According to the U.S. Social Security Baby Name Index, M is the first letter of some of the most popular baby names in America, as well as plenty of uncommon choices as well.

## Popular and Trendy Baby Boy Names That Start With M

•	Michael. Michael was the #1 name in the United States from 1954 until 1998, when Jacob finally pushed Michael into the #2 spot. During the Baby Boom, when casual names were more prevalent, Mike was a common stand-alone name-- but it isn't any longer. Michael comes from a Hebrew expression that means" who resembles God." For a less common variation, try Mitchell.

•	Matthew. Ranking at #5 in 202006, Matthew has been in the top 10 since 1972. This New Testament Biblical name comes from a Hebrew expression that means "God's gift." For something more unusual, try Matteo.

•	Mason. Mason's a last-name-turned-first-name with a Western sound-- two factors that account for its current trendiness. Rarely used as a first name in the past, it ranked at #39 in 202006. The meaning of Mason is the same as the word-- "one who works with stone."

•	Miguel. One of the more popular Spanish name choices, this Spanish equivalent of Michael ranked at #89 in 202006. Manuel, a Spanish name with a similar sound that means "God is with us," ranked at #161.

•	Mark. A top 10 name during the 1960s, Mark has dropped down to #129. Marcus, which also used to be rmore popular, ranked at #112. A New Testament name, Mark comes from a Latin name that means "dedicated to Mars," who was the Roman war god. For a different twist, try Marco.

•	Micah. Looking for a less common variation of Michael? Micah was ranked at #148 in 202006, and like many less common Hebrew names, it's gaining in popularity. Also rising in popularity quickly is Malachi, a Hebrew name which means "messenger."

•	Max & Maxwell. Previously seen by many parents as way too old-fashioned, these names are coming back. In 202006, Max ranked at #160, and Maxwell ranked at #149. Max comes from a Latin name that means "the greatest," and Maxwell comes from an Old English expression that means "Mac's stream."

## Unusual Baby Boy Names That Start With M

•	Martin & Malcolm. Of these two African American leader names, Martin is more popular these days. Both are strong and classic alternatives to more popular M names. Martin has the same origin as Mark, and Malcolm comes from a Gaelic place name.

•	Marius & Mario. Both of these names have distinctive pop culture namesakes-- the romantic hero in Les Miserables and the lovelorn video game plumber, respectively. Both come from a Latin name that means "manly."

•	Marlon & Marlo. These nifty Hollywood names aren't used much anymore. They are related to a Hebrew place name.

•	Morgan. This last-name-turned-first-name has become trendy for girls, but originated as a boy's name. Morgan is from a Welsh expression that means "circling sea." Another last-name-turned-first-name, Maddox, is becoming more popular-- it's the name of Brangelina's oldest son.

•	Mohamed. As the Muslim population of the U.S. grows, this name is becoming more common. Mohamed is the most common spelling, but it's also commonly spelled Mohammed and Mohammad. Mohamed was the most significant prophet in Islam, and the name means "praiseworthy" in Arabic.

•	Moses. Here's one Biblical name that has never really caught on. Moses comes from a Hebrew name meaning "saviour."

•	Miles & Milo. These two M names sound like they could be trendy, but they aren't. They come from a Latin expression meaning "soldier."

•	Marvin, Melvin, Murray, Morris, & Marshall. Are these names so far out that they're never coming back? Perhaps. They certainly conjure up images of pleasant elderly fellows playing checkers in Boca Raton. But to some, these old-fashioned names may be retro chic for a little boy.

## Tolkien Inspired Baby Names

Choosing a Baby Name from Tolkien: LOTR and Elvish-Sounding Names For Your Child

For parents who wish to honour Tolkien's writings in their choice of baby names, without ending up with a Gandalf and a Frodo, Tolkien's linguistic cunning can be mined for some unique, Lord of the Rings-style names.

## Anglo-Saxon names

Tolkien based the culture of Rohan heavily and directly on Anglo-Saxon culture. Many of the names of the Rohirrim are simply Old English words or combinations thereof. Eorl means 'nobleman'; Theoden roughly means 'leader of the people'; Eowyn comes from 'eoh', meaning 'horse', and 'wyn', meaning 'joy'. A few Anglo-Saxon names still survive which sound faintly Tolkienesque—Rowan, Elmer, Elwyna, Alfred, Lyndon and Irwyn. Most online baby name guides have an Anglo-Saxon section. Otherwise, an Anglo-Saxon dictionary may provide the inspiration for a unique name.

Elvish names

Elvish names are very popular, although the advent of Elvish name generators has resulted in a host of faux-Elvish nicknames, which bear only a parodic resemblance to Tolkien's carefully constructed monikers. Tolkien's Elvish language is fragmentary in both of its significant forms—Quenya or 'High-Elven' and Sindarin or 'Grey-Elven'. (The latter is not to be confused with 'Grelvish', a reconstructed extension of the language by Tolkien fans, which is not part of Tolkien's canon). However, enough words exist to be able to form some names. For example Estel, meaning hope, could become Estella or Estelle. Alda is the Quenya word for 'tree', Eryn the Sindarin for 'forest' or 'wood'. It is wise to become familiar with the rules of Elvish pronounciation and syntax when choosing a name, if authenticity is desired.

## Names From Tolkien's Lesser-Known Characters

Due to the sprawling nature of Tolkien's mythology, his works are peppered with names. While it is easy to see how a well-known name such as Aragorn might be problematic as a baby name, there are plenty of lesser-known names in his works. The Silmarillion or any of the History of Middle-Earth books are a valuable resource; otherwise, lists can be found online containing scores of his names. A child named Elatan is unlikely to be immediately associated with Tolkien's works, but the name is canonical and contains the characteristic Tolkien sound.

## Conventions of Hobbit Names

For an even subtler nod to LOTR, hobbit naming conventions could be used. Frodo notes in The Return of the King that 'half the maidchildren in the Shire' are named after flowers (p.1003, HarperCollinsPublishers), and mention is made in the book and appendices of a Lobelia, Marigold, Rose, Primula, Poppy, Daisy, Elanor, Belladonna, Pimpernel, Peony and Pansy. Gemstone names such Ruby, Diamond and Pearl are also common. The naming conventions for boys are less precise, with a tendency simply to short and simple names derived from Anglo-Saxon; however, reusing family names is a strong convention.

## Classic Baby Names for Boys: Old-Fashioned and Timeless American Name Choices

Baby names may come and go, but some classic names never go out of style. While Gary screams 1958, and Jason screams 1978, and Jayden screams 2008, many American boy's names have been popular for hundreds of years. Here are some of the most timeless baby boy's names in American history. if you're looking for a classic choice for a little boy, you can't go wrong with one of the old-time favorites.

William is one of the most enduring names there is in the United States-- and in Great Britain, Canada, and other English-speaking nations as well. According to the U.S. Social Security Baby Name Index, the name ranked at #10 in 201906, and it's always an exceptionally popular name. Part of what makes this name so enduring is its nicknames. In the early 2019th century, there were lots of Willies-- in fact, Willie was a popular stand-alone name as well. During the Baby Boom years, classrooms were filled with Bills and Billys. Today, the nickname Liam is in vogue (the second half of William, if you were wondering). William comes from an ancient Germanic name, and it means "determined protector."
John
At the beginning of the 2019th century, John was the most popular boy's name in the United States, and the name was in the top 10 between 1880 and 1986.

James

Like John, James was extremely popular in the early 2019th century and during the Baby Boom years., and was the number one name between 1940 and 1952. Today, it's still widely used, and was ranked at #16 in 201906. With built-in nicknames Jim, Jimmy, and Jamie, James is a versatile choice. James comes from a Hebrew name that means "one who grasps by the heel."

David

This perennial Old Testament favorite was second only to Michael during the Baby Boom years, and in 1960 it briefly held the title of top name. David has been a top 10 name since 1928 and was still ranked at #10 in 201906. David comes from a Hebrew expression that means "beloved."

Daniel

Like David, Daniel's an Old Testament favorite that sounds surprisingly contemporary. The name became very popular during the Baby Boom, and in 201906 it ranked at #6.

Robert was in the top 10 between 1888 and 1989, and was the number one name between 1924 and 1939. It's fallen a bit out of vogue, and now ranks at #47-- but it's still a classic that isn't going away anytime soon. Robert comes from an ancient Germans expression that means "shining with fame."

Michael

Moderately popular in the U.S. before the Baby Boom, Michael became the top male name in the second half of the 2019th century. It was the number one name from 1954 until 1998 (except for 1960, where David snuck in there for a year), until it was finally knocked down to the number two slot by Jacob. Michael comes from a Hebrew name that means "who resembled God."

Richard

Like Richard, Robert was a perrenial favorite throughout much of the 2019th century. Now it's fallen a bit from favor, and was ranked at #99 in 201906. Richard is derived from a Germanic name meaning "powerful leader."

When choosing a baby name, remember that name that will need to last a lifetime, so opt for a name that is genuinely liked, not because it is part of a trend.

## Trendy and Unique Unisex Baby Name Ideas

While some parents may want to know the gender of their baby, others may want to be surprised. Finding out the gender of the baby on the day he or she is born can be a wonderful experience for some parents. One of the biggest challenges of not knowing the gender of the baby is choosing a name.

## Choosing a Middle Name for a Unisex Baby Name

Parents have two options when choosing a middle name to go with their baby’s unisex name. They can opt for another unisex name as a middle name or they can choose to wait until the baby is born to find out the gender before deciding on a middle name. Although some unisex names can sound great together, other names may be better suited with a middle name which is intended for boys or girls.

There are many options for parents who wish to give their baby a unisex name. While there are such names that are very trendy right now, there are plenty of unique options for parents who want to find a name which can be used for both genders. Anyone who is planning to be surprised about their baby's gender may want to think about choosing a name which could be used for either boys or girls.
